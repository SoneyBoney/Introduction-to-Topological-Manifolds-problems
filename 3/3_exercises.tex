\begin{p}{Exercise 3.12}
    (c) If $(p_i)$ is a sequence of points in $S$ and $p\in S$, then $p_i \to p$ in $S$ if and only if
    $p_i \to p$ in $X$.\\
    (d) Every subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.\\
    (e) Every subspace of a first countable space is first countable.\\
    (f) Every subspace of a second countable space is second countable.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{Exercise 3.12}
    (c) Assume $p_i \to p$ in $S$. Since for all open neighborhoods $V_p$ in $S$, there exists $U_p$ in $X$ such
    that $V_p \subseteq U_p$, $p_i \to p$ in $X$ as well.\\
    Assume $p_i \to p$ in $X$. Since it is a sequence of points in $S$, by definition, for each open set intersect
    $S$, blah blah blah, $p_i \to p$ in $S$ as well.\\
    (d) Let $X$ be Hausdorff. Let $S$ be a subspace. Let $x,y \in S$. Then there exists
    $U_x$ an $U_y$ open sets of $X$ such that they are disjoint. Since they are disjoint, intersecting them 
    with $S$ still leaves them disjoint.\\
    (d) Every point has a neighborhood basis in $X$; taking the intersection of that neighborhood with $S$, 
    each basis element intersected with $S$ is open in $S$ and by definition is a basis for that neighborhood.\\
    (e) By part by, the basis for the subspace is the collection of basis elements intersected with $S$, which 
    is countable since the original basis is countable.
\end{s}


\begin{p}{Exercise 3.13}
       Let $X$ be a topological space and let $S$ be a subspace of $X$.
       Show that the inclusion map $S \hookrightarrow X$ is a topological embedding.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{Exercise 3.13}
       Restricting the co-domain to just $S$ yields the bijective identity, which is a homeomorphism.
\end{s}

\begin{p}{Exercise 3.14}
       Give an example of a topological embedding that is neither an open map nor a closed map.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{Exercise 3.14}
       The inclusion map is a topological embedding. So for any topological space $X$, choose a subset
       that is neither closed nor open, and thus the inclusion map from such a subset to $X$ is neither
       open nor closed.
\end{s}


\begin{p}{Exercise 3.15}
       A surjective topological embedding is a homeomorphism.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{Exercise 3.15}
       The restriction of a surjective topological embedding is the whole co-domain itself, thus the whole
       map is both injective and surjective so it's bijective and thus a homeomorphism with respect to
       the whole co-domain.
\end{s}




\begin{p}{Exercise 3.25}
    $$\mathscr{B}=\{U_1 \times \dots \times U_n : U_i \text{ is an open subset of } X_i,\, i=1,\dots ,n \}$$
    Prove that $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for a topology.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{Exercise 3.25}
    Let $\mathscr{T}$ be the topology as follows: a subset of $X_1 \times \dots \times X_n$ is open if and 
    only if the projections into $X_1, \dots , X_n$ are open. \\
    By definition, each set in $\mathscr{B}$ is open. Let $U,V$ be arbitrary open subsets of the product space.
    Then it's components $U_i$s and $V_i$s are all open in $X_i$. Then $U_i \cap V_i$ is open in $X_i$.
    Then 
    $$U_1 \cap V_1 \times \dots \times U_n \cap V_n$$ 
    is open in the product space and is contained in 
    $$(U_1 \times ... \times U_n) \cap (V_1 \times ... \times V_n)$$
    Thus $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for $\mathscr{T}$.
    \qed
\end{s}


\begin{p}{3.29}
    Prove the preceding corollary using only the characteristic property of the product topology.\\
    If $X_1,...,X_n$ are topological spaces, each canonical projection
    $\pi_i : X_1 \times \dots \times X_n \to X_i$ is continuous.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{3.29}
    Let $Y=X_1,...,X_n$ and let $f$ be the identity map. Since the identity is always continuous, 
    each $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$ is also continuous. And since $f$ is identity, $f_i = \pi_i$. So
    the result follows.
    \qed
\end{s}



\begin{p}{3.32}
    Prove proposition 3.31:\\
    Let $X_1,...,X_n$ be topological spaces.\\
    (a) The product topology is "associative" in the sense that the three topologies on the set  
    $X_1\times X_3 \times X_3$, obtained by thinking of it as 
    $X_1\times X_3 \times X_3$ or $(X_1\times X_3) \times X_3$ or $X_1\times (X_3 \times X_3)$
    are equal.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{3.32}
    (a) Let $f((x_1,x_2),x_3) = (x_1,x_2,x_3)$. Bijection is clear. Now just need to prove continuity 
    of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.

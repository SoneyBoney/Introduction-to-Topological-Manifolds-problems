\begin{p}{problem 3.10}
    Suppose that $(X_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ is an indexed family of topological spaces, and $Y$ is an topological
    space. A map $f: \coprod_{\alpha \in A}X_\alpha \to Y$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to each 
    $X_\alpha$ is continuous. The disjoint union topology is the unique topology on $\coprod_{\alpha \in A}X_\alpha$ 
    with this property.
\end{p}
\begin{s}{problem 3.10}
    The gluing lemma shows that if each restriction is continuous, then $f$ is continuous.\\
    Assume that $f$ is continuous. Then the restriction to each $X_\alpha$ must also be continuous because
    each open set in $X_\alpha$ is also open in the disjoint union space since $X_\alpha$ is by definition open
    so any open set intersected with it is also open.\\
    The disjoint union topology is the unique topology with this property because...
